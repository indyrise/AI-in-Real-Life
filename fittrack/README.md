# FitTrack

**FitTrack** is a modern, AI-powered fitness tracker Progressive Web App (PWA) built for people who want simple, motivating, and privacy-focused workout tracking.

## ✨ Features

- **Intuitive Activity Logging:** Add and track workouts, dog walks, and daily activities.
- **Beautiful Calendar View:** See your workout plans/dates with clear month/day abbreviations.
- **Streak Tracking & Progress:** Visualize streaks and weekly activity completion.
- **Offline-First PWA:** Works seamlessly without internet and can be installed like a native app.
- **Zero Data Mix/Leak:** All user data is stored locally by default—no central server.
- **Easy Sharing:** Send the app link to others; each user gets their own isolated data vault.
- **Automatic Versioning:** Every code change is saved and synced to GitHub for full transparency.

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Install dependencies and run locally:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```
2. **Access the app:**  
   Open your browser to the local port (usually [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)).

3. **Deploy as a PWA:**  
   One-click deploy options and mobile-friendly install for easy testing.

## 📱 How It Works for Users

- Each person using FitTrack via the URL gets their own secure, local data vault.
- Stats, activities, and streaks are completely private (unless shared by the user).
- No analytics/telemetry by default—your fitness data stays with you.

## 🧠 AI & Insights

FitTrack was created to demonstrate how even simple AI-driven summaries and health insights can make daily fitness more motivating and personal. The included models offer gentle feedback, habit reminders, and insight into activity patterns.

## ⚙️ Configuration

- **IndexedDB:** Handles default local data storage.
- **Replit Auth (optional):** For experiments with user login/profiles.
- **PostgreSQL (optional):** Enable for cloud sync or multi-user (see notes below).

## 🔒 Privacy by Design

- No user accounts or data sharing unless explicitly enabled.
- Each device/browser instance is independent, ensuring users' fitness data is theirs alone.

## 📊 Analytics

- Google Analytics integration is available but **optional**.  
  To enable, set your `VITE_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID` environment variable.

## 🧑‍💻 Multi-User & Sync Notes
To support true multi-user accounts, live sync, and cross-device dashboards:
- Enable authentication + PostgreSQL backend.
- Update data models to associate all records with user IDs.
- Implement cloud/local sync patterns.
